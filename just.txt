This PR addresses multiple issues related to configuration alignment, data validation, slot capacity enforcement, timestamp updates, and cascade deletion behavior. The changes ensure compliance with the specification and improve data integrity across the system.

Supported Denominations Configuration
The SUPPORTED_DENOMINATIONS configuration was defined as [5, 10, 20, 50, 100], which does not match the specification requirement of [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100]. The configuration has been updated to include 1 and 2 to ensure consistency with the specification.

Price Validation in ItemCreate and ItemBulkEntry
The models ItemCreate and ItemBulkEntry previously allowed price >= 0 using ge=0. The specification requires price > 0. Validation has been updated to enforce strictly positive prices using gt=0, preventing zero-priced items from being created.

Incorrect Capacity Check in add_item_to_slot
The capacity validation logic in add_item_to_slot was incorrect in two ways:
The condition checked whether the new quantity was less than the maximum and raised a capacity_exceeded error, which reversed the intended logic.
The check used settings.MAX_ITEMS_PER_SLOT instead of the slot’s defined capacity.
The logic has been corrected to:
Properly detect when the new total quantity exceeds capacity.
Validate against slot.capacity instead of a global configuration value.

Missing Capacity Validation and Count Update in bulk_add_items
The bulk_add_items function did not validate against slot capacity and did not update slot.current_item_count after inserting items. This could lead to inconsistent inventory data.
The function now:
Validates total quantity against the slot’s capacity before insertion.
Updates slot.current_item_count after successful insertion to maintain consistency.

Incorrect Handling of updated_at in update_item_price
The update_item_price method was explicitly resetting the updated_at field to its previous value, preventing proper timestamp updates. This behavior has been removed to allow the ORM or database layer to update the timestamp automatically as intended.

Cascade Behavior on Slot Deletion
In models.py, the Slot relationship was configured with cascade="save-update, merge", which does not delete associated items when a slot is removed. This could result in orphaned item records.
The cascade configuration has been updated to ensure that related items are properly handled when a slot is deleted, maintaining referential integrity.
